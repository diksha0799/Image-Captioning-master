# Image-Captioning
This is a project in which I have to generate captions from a given Image dataset

##  Motivation/Purpose: 
-  We learn how to load and pre-process data from the COCO dataset. We  also designed a CNN-RNN model for automatically generating image captions.

### Major Milestone would be:
#### 1 Explore the Data Loader
#### 2 Use the Data Loader to Obtain Batches.
#### 3 Experiment with the CNN Encoder.
#### 4 Implement the RNN Decoder

## Explaining Encoder and Decoder
  ## Encoder:

  For Encoder we use ResNet-50. ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The network is 50 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224.   

## Decode:

For Decoder we use LSTM. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a modified version of recurrent neural networks, which makes it easier to remember past data in memory. The vanishing gradient problem of RNN is resolved here. LSTM is well-suited to classify, process and predict time series given time lags of unknown duration. It trains the model by using back-propagation
